# Synaptic-Self-Organization-of-Spatio-Temporal-Pattern-Selectivity

Fig1, Fig2, Fig3, Fig4, and Fig5:

First execute Model_Learning.m for p1=1:1:500, and p2=1:1:3.
Then to plot figure 1, execute  Fig1.m, figure 2a: Fig_2a.m, and so on.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Fig6:

First, execute then Model_Learning.m for  p1=1:1:500, and p2=1:1:3. second execute Model_test_Noise.m for  p1=1:1:500, and p2=1:1:3. Then execute Fig_6a.m, Fig_6b.m, and Fig_6c.m

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Fig7:

First: execute the Model_Learning_noise.m for  p1=1:1:500 and p2=1. 
Second: execute Model_test_Noise_2.m for p1=1:1:500 and p2=1.
Third: execute  Fig_7a.m, Fig_7b.m, and Fig_7c.m

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Fig8a,b ,and d:

First execute Model_Learning_2_em for p1=1:500 and p2=1. Then execute Fig_8ab.m and Fig_8d.m

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Fig8c:

First, execute the Model_Learning_4_em.m for  p1=1:1:100 and p2=1. 
Second execute Fig_8c.m

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Fig9a, c:

First, execute Model_Learning_NET_1.m (p1:1:50 and p2=1:4), then Fig_9a.m, Fig_9c.m 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Fig9b:

First, execute Model_Learning_NET_2.m (p1:1:500 and p2=4), then Fig_9b.m

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Fig9d:

This figure was obtained from an extensive simulation. For every number of embedded patterns, we considered post-synaptic neurons from 2:2:30. Each point is from an average of 50 simulations.
Model_Learning_NET_1.m is the primary program to plot Fig 9d. However, the position of the embedded pattern should be defined as a fixed position. (it is independent of the pattern position.)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Fig10:

First: Execute Model_Learning_NET_3.m (p1:1:50 and p2=6)
Second: execute Fig_10.m

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Fig12:

First: execute the Model_Learning_f0.m for  p1=1:1:100 and p2=1:3. 
Second: execute Fig_12.m
